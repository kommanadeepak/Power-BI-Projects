# Sales Dashoard
I have downloaded the sample super store data from online.
You can get that data at in my Power-BI-Projects repository.
I have imported that data on to the Power BI desktop, before loading that data I have trnsformed the data according to my requirement.
You can transform it depending on what insights you want from that data.
Then I have loaded that data into Power BI Desktop.
It has redirected to report section in the Power BI Desktop.
There I have used various visualization tools and filters to prepare reports from the dataset I have loaded.
After preparing reports then I have published on my Power BI service, there I have created dashboard with 3 sheets of reports.
# You can download Power BI desktop at Microsoft store.
